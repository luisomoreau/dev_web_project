dev_web_project
===============

This is a student web development project in order to evaluate our ability to code
Objectives are to develop a website using HTML5, CSS3, js and AJAX for the first part.
The second part is to connect this project to a database using JEE.

Another criteria is to use a versionning workspace. I chose Git and Github.
We are not allowed to use any CSS framework, thus sorry if design isn't fully responsive. I'll do my best ;)
