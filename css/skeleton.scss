/*
  I always wanted to build my own css responsive grid framework, so I'll try to do it in that project.
  I took some inspiration about the basic need on an alsacreation article : Bonnes pratiques en CSS : BEM et OOCSS.
  Link here : http://www.alsacreations.com/article/lire/1641-bonnes-pratiques-en-css-bem-et-oocss.html

  I'll build the framework following the different steps:
  1/ Variables definition
  2/ Building the grid system
  3/ Designing elements (I'll use Photoshop or Dreamweaver don't know yet)
  4/ Make it responsive
  5/ Make it compatible with the main browsers
  6/ Create a min.css for better performances

  Thanks to 960grid, alsacreation and Hongkiat articles and tutorials that helped me a lot !!

/* Variables definition */

/* Colors
  As I am color-blind I'm glad to use tools to respect good colors principal
  Here is a good article to find your theme colors : http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/best-color-tools-for-web-designers/
  I finally chose adobe color CC tool (older name was kuler adobe)

$primary-color: rgb(16,40,64);

/* Screen sizes for media queries */
/*
  I've been using the following website to get an idea of the different screen size
  I chose not to make any difference between portrait and landscape orientation. It will may be in a next version :)
  I've made the difference between 3 screen sizes, consider this as mobile, tablet and laptop

  I've followed mambows advices : https://github.com/mambows/simple-compass-css (OpenSource repo)

$container-max-width :   1200px; //I May not use it depending on test results
$columnWidth :      6; //In percent.
$column :           12; //Twelve columns as most of the css frameworks today (Foundation, 960grid or Boostrap)

// Let's do some math here
// Define gutter width
// Gutter is space between column, in this case we have twelve columns.
// First lets multiply column width with amount of column.
//
//    5.5% X 12 = 66%
//
// This is total column width without gutter.
// In one row, column and gutter have total width of 100%, so subtract 100 with total column width
//
//    100% - 66% = 34%
//
// Last, divide that number with amount of gutter, to get amount of gutter,
// just subtract amount of column with 1
//
//    34% / ( 12 - 1 ) = 3.0909%
//
// That is our gutter width. And here is our final gutter's formula
$columnGutter   : (100 - ($columnWidth * $column)) / ($column - 1);
