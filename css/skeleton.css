  I always wanted to build my own css responsive grid framework, so I'll try to do it in that project.
  I took some inspiration about the basic need on an alsacreation article : Bonnes pratiques en CSS : BEM et OOCSS.
  Link here : http://www.alsacreations.com/article/lire/1641-bonnes-pratiques-en-css-bem-et-oocss.html

  I'll build the framework following the different steps:
  1/ Variables definition
  2/ Building the grid system
  3/ Designing elements (I'll use Photoshop or Dreamweaver don't know yet)
  4/ Make it responsive
  5/ Make it compatible with the main browsers
  6/ Create a min.css for better performances

  Thanks to 960grid, alsacreation and Hongkiat articles and tutorials that helped me a lot !!

/* Colors
  As I am color-blind I'm glad to use tools to respect good colors principal
  Here is a good article to find your theme colors : http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/best-color-tools-for-web-designers/
  I finally chose adobe color CC tool (older name was kuler adobe)
